## Overview

After many iterations and lots of great feedback from the LAGD community, what
you see here is the logo and color palette that weâ€™ve landed on for now. Thanks
to the Noun Project, whose commnunity of artists provided the basis for the
fleur-de-lis shape and the general look of the controller. We will continue to
refine and improve the design but for now this is the look of LAGD!
